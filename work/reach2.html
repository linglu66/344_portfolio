				<p>The mentor search system should align with the mental model that mentees have - an example of this is clothing shopping. If you're buying clothes, (most) retailers don't divide clothes by colour on their home page. They show you the newest releases and general headers for women and men's fashion. Then you can select a type of clothing, like pants or shoes. And after that you can filter by colour, size, or specific styles.
					<br><br>
					Similarly, mentees I met with agreed with the following mental model:
						  - Topic Expertise (finding jobs, academics, social life, clubs)
						  - Demographics (year, program, cultural background)
						  - Hobbies and Interests
						  <br><br>
					I provided two possible flows in the search system - mentees can either view mentors that are matched algorithmically to them, or they can manually browse through mentors with specific criteria. If they choose to browse, mentees can first filter by topic category and select either the entire category, or specific experiences under the topics. After they submit the query, they can browse through the results or further filter by demographics or hobbies and interests.
					<br><br>
					As a school with many international students, I believe that it's important to allow filtering by cultural background. International students especially, report high rates of depression and loneliness - this can help them find students who they can better relate to and connect with.</p>

					During the onboarding process, I streamlined the mentor profile writing with a few concepts.
					<br>
					<br>
					Providing general topics as prompts<br>
					Pre-written, common experiences they can select<br>
					Writing their own experiences as a last resort<br>
					Leaving scheduling and more detailed inputs for later on<br>
					<br>
					By providing topic prompts instead of just asking them to write their expertise from scratch, we're lowering the user's activation energy and also reminding them of experiences they might have not remembered otherwise. Specificity is also important in this case. It's much more useful to a mentee to see that a mentor is 'experienced in navigating group projects' rather than 'academics'.

				<p>
					In most of the mentorship programs I interacted with, there were more mentees than mentors. Mentors are dealing with a lot of mentorship requests, so my goal is to design a request process where mentors can easily assess which requests would be the best fit, and mentees are encouraged to send requests specifying what they want to learn from a mentor. This will give mentors a better idea of whether they can teach a mentee what they want to know, and also deter mentees from mass-sending requests by increasing the effort required to send one.

			<!-- <h3> ðŸ¤” Learnings and Reflections </h3>

			This experience really pushed the importance of good, regular communication in design work. I think in a startup, it can be tempting to just pump through tasks for the sake of completion, but I realized that establishing a strong cross-team collaboration mindset is immensely beneficial.
			<br><br>

			Involving PMs and developers more throughout the process would have helped us avoid bumps like miscommunication about the feasibility of certain features, or the small issues arising that led us astray from the design.

			<br><br>
			As a designer I also learned to be more detailed in how I pass on my designs - every screen should have a few copies of how they would look on different sizes, edge cases like really long text boxes or empty states also need to be designed since people do not read minds - just cause' I know how it looks, if it's not visible, there's no guarantee that it'll turn out how it's expected to be. -->
