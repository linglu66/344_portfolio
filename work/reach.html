			<h3> The Problem </h3>


			<p class='center_text'>
        <!-- Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life.
        Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how
        someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees. -->
				<!-- <br><br> -->
        <!-- There are a lot of disjointed mentorship systems at UofT that fall short in the experience department.

        I wanted to design a new mentorship experience that would make it easy for students to find mentors that match their interests, while simplifying
        the logistics of relationship management and scheduling. -->

				Mentorship is an interesting problem to think about in the university context
				- students are going through a huge growth phase and juggling a million things at once (I would know).
				Although we have more experienced students, many of them are still growing, meaning we have students who wish to both have mentors and be a mentor to someone else.
				It's also easy for students to feel lonely, with a school as big as UofT. Mentorship is a great way to create meaningful relationships in the student community
				<br><br>
				I wanted to design a mentorship experience that makes finding a mentor easy and comfortable for mentees, and smooth out the relationship management
				and logistics scheduling for mentors.

			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è User Interviews </h3>
        To get more clarity on the mindsets and goals of mentors and mentee students, I held open-ended interviews with a few mentors and mentees active in the
        WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) and Industrial Engineering mentorship programs. I also spoke with a co-ordinator who runs one of the mentorship
				programs mentioned.

        <br><br>
        Questions
			<ul class='tchart'>

				<ul>
          <li>What does mentorship mean to you?</li>
          <li>Why do you want to be a mentor?</li>
          <li>What do you want to offer as a mentor?</li>
          <li>What is challenging about being a mentor?</li>
          <li>What is enjoyable about being a mentor?</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>What does being a mentee mean to you?</li>
          <li>What do you expect from your mentorship?</li>
          <li>What do you want to learn from your mentor?</li>
          <li>How do you currently find mentors?</li>
          <li>Why do you seek mentorship?</li>
        </ul>
			</ul>



			<h3> üö∂üèΩ‚Äç User Profiles </h3>

      <!-- <h3> ü§ï Pain Points </h3>
      We want to reduce the challenges users have to their core components, so we can build solutions that solve the problems from the root.
      <br><br>
      Mentorship can be awkward for students. For one, it may be difficult for new students to even seek guidance. Many students related with
      idea of 'You don't know what you don't know'. What do you even want to ask about?

<br><br>
      It can also be difficult to find the right match. Either your mentor doesn't really know how to answer your questions, maybe you don't have the same
      level of commitment in mind, or your schedules never match up - logistics can be hard to figure out. Sometimes, you might feel like you just don't
			click with your mentor/mentee.
<br><br>
			For mentors, there seems to be a high barrier to entry. Mentors have to fill out a detailed form, writing paragraphs about their experience and why they'd
			be a good mentor. Afterwards, they would be interviewed and matched with a mentee. A good question to consider is how can we maintain balance
			between the detail of mentor information and the ease of mentor onboarding. -->

      <h2> Defining the problem </h2>
      Based on the interviews, my understanding of the users, and pain points that were revealed, I scoped the problem space down to a core set of issues
			that the experience should handle.

      <h4>1. Help mentees find mentors with expertise in the areas they seek guidance in</h4>
			Pain points:
			<ul>
				<li>Mentor not knowing how to answer their questions</li>
				<li>Mentor does not have similar experiences to what they're going through</li>
				<li>Mentees unsure of what they want to learn about</li>
			</ul>

<!--
    - topic expertise
    - demographic match - (i.e. 4th year, industrial engineering, also chinese-canadian)
    - extra curriculars/interests -->
		<h4>2. Help mentors easily express what they have specific experience in/topics they want to mentor about</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Long onboarding process for mentors, filling in lots of Q&A</li>
			<li>Not sure what to write, just want to help out</li>
			<li>Don't remember all the things they want to mentor about when signing up</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- - having a rich profile -->
    By being specific and making more detailed profiles, we can better connect the right people together.
		<h4>3. Balance demand and supply between mentors/mentees</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Mentor receving a lot of requests, it's overwhelming</li>
			<li>Mentor don't know which mentees they can actually give good advice to</li>
			<li>Mentees feel like they are asking for too much</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- - imbalance of power - mentees may feel like they're asking too much of mentors or being a burden -->
		<!-- - mentors have too many mentees to handle -->
		<!-- <h4>4. Create accountability in both parties</h4>
		Pain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Mentor/meeting bailed on meeting</li>
		</ul> -->
		<!-- - making sure that users are accountable - making mentorship a formal request process
				- mentee sends request and message, while being able to view the mentor's available time commitment , preferred modes of communication
				- mentor can choose to start chatting or accept/decline the invite
		- holding mentors/mentees accountable for agreed meets -->

			<h2> ‚ú® Design Solution</h2>


			Based on the problem definition, I had a decent idea of the main functionalities that the application should have.
			I outlined a rough task flow in Sketch first.

		<div class='center_text'>
			<!-- <img src="../pics/reach/flow.png", width="100%"> -->

			From there, I fleshed out some wireframe solutions for the main problems. A guiding concept for the design was the idea of
			giving both parties the best information they can use to determine whether a mentor/mentee would be a good fit.
			<br><br>
			<h3>1. Help mentees find mentors with expertise in the areas they seek guidance in</h3>

			The mentor search system should align with the mental model that mentees have - an example of this is clothing shopping.
			If you're buying clothes, (most) retailers don't divide clothes by colour on their home page. They show you the newest releases
			and general headers for women and men's fashion. Then you can select a type of clothing, like pants or shoes.
			And after that you can filter by colour, size, or specific styles.
			<br><br>
			Similarly, mentees I interviewed aligned with the following mental model:
			<ol>
				<li>Topic Expertise (finding jobs, academics, social life, clubs)</li>
				<li>Demographics (year, program, cultural background)</li>
				<li>Hobbies and Interests</li>
			</ol>
			I provided two possible flows in the search system - mentees can either view mentors that are matched algorithmically to them, or they can
			manually browse through mentors with specific criteria.
			If they choose to browse, mentees can first filter by topic category and select either the entire category,
			or specific experiences under the topics. After they submit the query, they can browse through the results or further
			filter by demographics or hobbies and interests.
			<br><br>
			As a school with many international students, I believe that it's important to allow filtering by cultural background. International
			students especially, report high rates of depression and loneliness - this can help them find students who they can better relate to and
			connect with.
			<!-- Working from the mentee side, I designed a browsing system that accurately reflected the selection flow. -->
			<br><br>

			During the onboarding process, I streamlined the mentor profile writing with a few concepts.
			<ol>
				<li>Providing general topics as prompts</li>
				<li>Pre-written, common experiences they can select</li>
				<li>Writing their own experiences as a last resort</li>
				<li>Leaving scheduling and more detailed inputs for later on</li>
			</ol>

			By providing topic prompts instead of just asking them to write their expertise from scratch,
			we're lowering the user's activation energy and also reminding them of experiences they might
			have not remembered otherwise.

			Specificity is also important in this case. It's much more useful to a mentee to see that a mentor is 'experienced in navigating group projects'
			rather than 'academics'.

			In most of the mentorship programs I interacted with, there were more mentees than mentors. Mentors are dealing with a lot
			of mentorship requests, so my goal is to design a request process where mentors can easily assess which requests would be the best fit, and
			mentees are encouraged to send requests specifying what they want to learn from a mentor. This will give mentors a better idea of whether
			they can teach a mentee what they want to know, and also deter mentees from mass-sending requests by increasing the effort required to send one.

	<h3>Future work</h3>

I believe that design work can always be improved on. Some things I‚Äôve been thinking about to iterate on in this product:

<ul>
	<li><h4>Improving the meetup experience</h4>
		Video calling, Phone calling
		<br><br>
		Maps for meeting on campus - new students may have trouble finding their way around, it would be helpful to have some
		interactive layout of the school for picking meetup locations
		<br><br>
		Since students have a fairly consistent weekly schedule, we can allow students to upload their calendars and easily pick
		times that work for both parties to use for mentoring

	</li>
	<li><h4>Group mentorship</h4>
		Creating small groups of 3-4 mentees who have similar interests, and connecting them with one mentor would also be a solution to the demand and supply imbalance, while also creating more connections between mentees.

	</li>

	<li><h4>Mentorship events</h4>
		A cool feature would be to co-ordinate live mentorship events that involve fun activities, or have a mixer
		where mentors and mentees can find each-other.

	</li>
</ul>


			<!-- <h3> ü§î Learnings and Reflections </h3>

			This experience really pushed the importance of good, regular communication in design work. I think in a startup, it can be tempting to just pump through tasks for the sake of completion, but I realized that establishing a strong cross-team collaboration mindset is immensely beneficial.
			<br><br>

			Involving PMs and developers more throughout the process would have helped us avoid bumps like miscommunication about the feasibility of certain features, or the small issues arising that led us astray from the design.

			<br><br>
			As a designer I also learned to be more detailed in how I pass on my designs - every screen should have a few copies of how they would look on different sizes, edge cases like really long text boxes or empty states also need to be designed since people do not read minds - just cause' I know how it looks, if it's not visible, there's no guarantee that it'll turn out how it's expected to be. -->
