					<div class="subtitle">Align with the users' mental model</div>
					<h2>1. Help mentees find mentors that are a good match for them</h2>

				</div>
				<p>The mentor search system should align with the mental model that mentees have - an example of this is
					clothing shopping. If you're buying clothes, (most) retailers don't divide clothes by colour on
					their home page. They show you the newest releases and general headers for women and men's fashion.
					Then you can select a type of clothing, like pants or shoes. And after that you can filter by
					colour, size, or specific styles.
					<br><br>
					Similarly, mentees I met with agreed with the following mental model:
					- Topic Expertise (finding jobs, academics, social life, clubs)
					- Demographics (year, program, cultural background)
					- Hobbies and Interests
					<br><br>
					I provided two possible flows in the search system - mentees can either view mentors that are
					matched algorithmically to them, or they can manually browse through mentors with specific criteria.

					As a school with many international students, I believe that it's important to allow filtering by
					cultural background. International students especially, report high rates of depression and
					loneliness - this can help them find students who they can better relate to and connect with.

					<br><br>

					I designed a sub-topic recommendation system to suggest topics in real time based on the user's profile
				and what sub-topic they last tapped on. </p>

					<h2>2. Streamline the mentor onboarding process</h2>
				</div>

				<p>
					During the onboarding process, I streamlined the mentor profile writing with a few concepts.
					<br>
					<br>
					Providing general topics as prompts<br>
					Pre-written, common experiences they can select<br>
					Writing their own experiences as a last resort<br>
					Leaving scheduling and more detailed inputs for later on<br>
					<br>
					By providing topic prompts instead of just asking them to write their expertise from scratch, we're
					lowering the user's activation energy and also reminding them of experiences they might have not
					remembered otherwise. Specificity is also important in this case. It's much more useful to a mentee
					to see that a mentor is 'experienced in navigating group projects' rather than 'academics'.

					<h2>3. Balance demand and supply</h2>

				</div>
				<p>
					In most of the mentorship programs I saw, there were more mentees than mentors.
					Mentors are dealing with a lot of mentorship requests, so
					I wanted to create a request process where mentors can easily assess which requests would be the best
					fit, and mentees are encouraged to send requests specifying what they want to learn from a mentor.

					This will give mentors
					a better idea of whether they can teach a mentee what they want to know, and also deter mentees from
					mass-sending requests by increasing the effort required to send one.<br><br>

					I used the quick view to allow mentors to get a good idea of what their prospective mentee is like,
					without bogging them down with two many details.
