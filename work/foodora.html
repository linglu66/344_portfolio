			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'> The prompt of this assignment was to choose a food-delivery service and redesign a major feature, using reasoning and data from user research. We asked ourselves a few questions: How can we improve the user experience of Foodora? How can we use the design process to understand and empathize with the user, identify major functionalities, and create and iterate on a low-fidelity prototype?

			<h1> The Process </h1>
			<h3> üîç Research and Understanding our Users </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>

				We designed a survey and gathered data from over 70 reddit users, to understand specifically why people use food delivery apps and their motivations at each stage. We wanted to see what the general thought process was (does dish matter more? or restaurant?) as well as any pain points in the journey.

				The insights helped us define a few major use cases of Foodora that we could iterate on.

			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Task Analysis + Definition </h3>	
			
			The purpose of the task analysis was to clearly define primary functions of the system, examine user goals, as well as their means to achieve them and whether the system allows them to do so in an efficient manner. From the results of our research, we concluded on 3 different main tasks.

			<ul>
				<li>Account Creation,  </li>
				<li>Restaurant/food Selection</li>
				<li>Checkout</li>

			</ul>
			We decided that browsing food/restaurant should be redesigned, as there were the most conflicts between the users preferences and how the interface works - as indicated by the research conducted.<br><br>
			Taking a detailed look at the HTA charts:

			<p class='caption'> Hierarchical task analysis of the 'Food Selection' userflow </p>

			<img src='../pics/foodora/hta_restaurantselection.png' class='image  padding'>
			<p class='caption'> Hierarchical task analysis of the 'Restaurant Selection' userflow </p>


			We wanted to merge the two user flows into one. It seemed unintuitive that the search functionality was completely different for food and restaurant.

			<h3> üëî Results: A Low-fidelity Prototype </h3>
			We redesigned the user experience based on three main issues:

			<ol>
				<li> Lack of flexibility and efficiency in browsing food and restaurants </li>
				<li> Lack of discriminability and high information access cost</li>
				<li> Information hierarchy in food cards did not conform to user preferences </li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>To target the first issue, we designed an interface that allowed users to freely switch between browsing food and restaurants.</p>
			<img src='../pics/foodora/focus_restaurantSearch.png' class='image'>
			<p>To reduce the information access cost to the checkout, we emphasized the total cost and time to delivery in the checkout hover card.</p>
			<img src='../pics/foodora/focus_checkout.png'  class='image'>
			<p>We also redesigned the foodcards so that it was obvious which items were required to complete the order and which weren't, as well as move required items to the top.</p>
			<img src='../pics/foodora/focus_card.png' class='image'>

			<h3> üëî User Testing and Observations</h3>

			We designed a user test consisting of an introduction script, preliminary survey, the testing of three tasks using a think-aloud protocol, and a post-test interview. 
			The three tasks were: finding a dish, finding a restaurant, and customizing and adding a dish to the cart.
			<br><br>
			We tested on students that were not Foodora users but also had some familiarity with online food ordering.  
			<br><br>

			The top five issues were:
			<li>users did not understand the food description icons</li>
			<li>users did not understand the ‚ÄúSearch by (restaurant/food‚Äù switch </li> 
			<li>users could not find the  ‚Äúquick add to cart‚Äù button on food items </li>
			<li>users could not find the ‚Äúfilter‚Äù button</li> 
			<li>users did not know whether or not food customization options had additional charges</li> 

			<br>Potential solutions for these issues would be, for the next design iteration, to increase salience of certain elements of the design, and to add adding additional descriptionary text to fill the user‚Äôs gap in knowledge. (i.e. tooltips)
