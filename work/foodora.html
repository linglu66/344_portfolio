			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'> The prompt of this assignment was to choose a food-delivery service and redesign a major feature, using reasoning and data from user research. We asked ourselves a few questions: How can we improve the user experience of Foodora? How can we use the design process to understand and empathize with the user, identify major functionalities, and create and iterate on a low-fidelity prototype?

			<h1> The Process </h1>
			<h3> üîç Research and Understanding our Users </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>

				We designed a survey and gathered data from over 70 reddit users, to understand specifically why people use food delivery apps and their motivations at each stage. We wanted to see what the general thought process was (does dish matter more? or restaurant?) as well as any pain points in the journey.</br></br>

				The insights helped us define a few major use cases of Foodora that we could iterate on.

			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Task Analysis + Definition </h3>	

			<ul>
				<li>Do you use Atlas? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
				<li>What are you trying to do in your machine learning projects?</li>
				<li>Is feature X valuable to the work you do right now?</li>
				<li>What do you look for in your experiment results?</li>

			</ul>

			I kept the interviews mostly open-ended (although it was a redesign, we still had a lot of flexibility with the features and user flow) and left with a few observations:

			<ul>
				<li>Users wanted more ways to directly assess their experiments</li>
				<li>In terms of workflows, there were some diverging preferences like whether to view all experiments together, or have separate views for ongoing/finished/queued</li>
				<li>The command line integration was clumsy</li>

			</ul>

			<h3> üëî Prototyping </h3>
			In addition to user preferences, there were some restrictions and additional functionalities to be designed for in the project scope.
			<ul>
				<li>The interface should support teams, i.e. be able to comment, sign in, have an account</li>
				<li>Non-machine-learning experts should be able to understand the project / get a sense of the progress </li>

			</ul>

			<h3> üìã Testing our Prototype </h3>
			In addition to user preferences, there were some restrictions and additional functionalities to be designed for in the project scope.

			<h3> üßê Takeaways </h3>
