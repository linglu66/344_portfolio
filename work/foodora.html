			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'> The prompt of this assignment was to choose a food-delivery service and redesign a major feature, using reasoning and data from user research. We asked ourselves a few questions: How can we improve the user experience of Foodora? How can we use the design process to understand and empathize with the user, identify major functionalities, and create and iterate on a low-fidelity prototype?

			<h1> The Process </h1>
			<h3> üîç Research and Understanding our Users </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>

				We designed a survey and gathered data from over 70 reddit users, to understand specifically why people use food delivery apps and their motivations at each stage. We wanted to see what the general thought process was (does dish matter more? or restaurant?) as well as any pain points in the journey.</br></br>

				The insights helped us define a few major use cases of Foodora that we could iterate on.

			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Task Analysis + Definition </h3>	
		We decided that browsing food/restaurant should be redesigned, as there were the most conflicts between the users preferences and how the interface works - as indicated by the research conducted.

			Taking a detailed look at the HTA charts:

			We wanted to merge the two user flows into one. It seemed unintuitive that the search functionality was completely different for food and restaurant.

			<h3> üëî Low-fidelity Prototyping </h3>
			We redesigned the user experience based on three main issues:

			<ol>
				<li> Lack of flexibility and efficiency in browsing food and restaurants </li>
				<li> Lack of discriminability and high information access cost</li>
				<li> Information hierarchy in food cards did not conform to user preferences </li>
			</ol>

			<ul>
				<li>Users wanted more ways to directly assess their experiments</li>
				<li>In terms of workflows, there were some diverging preferences like whether to view all experiments together, or have separate views for ongoing/finished/queued</li>
				<li>The command line integration was clumsy</li>

			</ul>

			

			<h3> üìã Testing our Prototype </h3>
			In addition to user preferences, there were some restrictions and additional functionalities to be designed for in the project scope.
