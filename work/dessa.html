			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>Machine learning is a field that is complex and nuanced, where everybody has their own preferred methods, infrastructures and technologies. However, there are certain pain points that are shared, like how to keep track of thousands of experiments,  models and results. The goal of our product, Atlas, was to make the lives of machine learning engineers easier with experiment management, resource management, and a way to track an and analyze results.

				I wanted to redesign our early-stage products to be simple and comfortable to use, while supporting different workflows and incorporating new features.

				<h3> Outcome </h3>	
				<ul>
					<li>A new, cleaner design that makes it easier to navigate and makes complex use-cases more intuitive</li>
					<li>Style guide for new features</li>

					<li>Complete visual redesign based on feedback collected from users </li>

			<h3> Research and design audit </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>

				My first task was to identify problems with the current interface. Just at a glance, I could see there was an overall lack of cohesiveness in the design. Being a technical product that displays a lot of data and visualizations, it's important to use design elements effectively so that information is properly displayed and can be absorbed in an intuitive way.</br></br>

				I conducted five user interviews to dig into their habits, find out what kind of usecases to design for, and what they feel is lacking from the current design.
