			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>Machine learning is a field that is complex and nuanced, where everybody has their own preferred methods, infrastructures and technologies. However, there are certain pain points that are shared, like how to keep track of thousands of experiments,  models and results. I wanted to redesign our early-stage products to be simple and comfortable to use, while supporting different workflows and incorporating new features.
