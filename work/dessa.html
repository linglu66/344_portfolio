		<h3 class='quote'>As a machine learning engineer, I know first-hand how messy the process can be. I was excited for the opportunity to do a deep dive of our machine learning products and give them a fresh face.</h3>

		<div class='center_text'>
			During summer 2019, I interned at the Dessa (formerly deeplearni.ng), as a machine learning engineer. Although ‚Äúmachine learning engineer‚Äù was my title, I was very fortunate to be able to take initiative beyond my role, facing a variety of design challenges in product design.
			<br><br>
			One of the main responsibilities I took on was improve the design of our flagship machine learning product, Atlas. As a sole designer, I worked closely with the product manager and development team to redesign our product to have a stronger design pattern and be more pleasant to use.
			<h3> The Problem </h3>


			<p class='center_text'>Machine learning is a field that is complex and nuanced, where everybody has their own preferred methods, infrastructures and technologies. However, there are certain pain points that are shared, like how to keep track of thousands of experiments,  models and results. The goal of our product, Atlas, was to make the lives of machine learning engineers easier with experiment management, resource management, and a way to track and analyze results.
				<br><br>
				I wanted to redesign our early-stage products to be simple and comfortable to use, while supporting different workflows and incorporating new features.

			</p>

		<div class='center_text list'>

			<h3> Outcome </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A new, cleaner design that makes it easier to navigate and makes complex use-cases more intuitive</li>
					<li>New overview page to support team functionality</li>

					<li>Complete visual redesign based on feedback collected from users </li>
				</ul>

			<h1> The Process </h1>
			<h3> üîç Research and design audit </h3>
			<p class='center_text'>
				I ran an initial assessment of Atlas with the product manager, where we identified gaps in the user experience, such as having no quick way to assess experiments. I held open-ended user interviews with our in-house machine learning engineers to talk about their needs, potential use cases and general feelings towards our product. The insights from the interviews highlighted useful details that guided the redesign.



			<!-- How can we make software to support engineers that is flexible, intuitive to use and feature-rich? -->
			</p>
			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Interview Questions </h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Do you use Atlas? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
				<li>What are you trying to do in your machine learning projects?</li>
				<li>Is feature X valuable to the work you do right now?</li>
				<li>What do you look for in your experiment results?</li>

			</ul>

			I kept the interviews mostly open-ended (although it was a redesign, we still had a lot of flexibility with the features and user flow) and left with a few observations:

			<ul>
				<li>Users wanted more ways to directly assess their experiments</li>
				<li>In terms of workflows, there were some diverging preferences like whether to view all experiments together, or have separate views for ongoing/finished/queued</li>
				<li>The command line integration was clumsy</li>

			</ul>

			<h3> üëî Stakeholder Requirements </h3>
			In addition to user preferences, there were some restrictions and additional functionalities to be designed for in the project scope.
			<ul>
				<li>The interface should support teams, i.e. be able to comment, sign in, have an account</li>
				<li>Non-machine-learning experts should be able to understand the project / get a sense of the progress </li>

			</ul>

			<h3> üìí Sketches and wireframes</h3>
			<img src="../pics/atlas/wireframes.png", width="100%">
			I condensed the findings into some initial wireframes and flows, discussed them with the PMs and head of product, and started creating the prototypes. Once the first iteration was developed, I held a design meeting with our machine learning and development teams to gather feedback. I cycled through iterating on the designs and running feedback meetings until we finished.


			<p class='center_text'>

			</p>
			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Design Iterations </h3>
			The first iteration: Working in all the new functionality, some design elements didn't make it all the way through to the prototype.
			<img src="../pics/dessa/iter1.png", width="100%">
			The second iteration: Exploring alternative ways to sort and view experiments.
			<img src="../pics/dessa/iter2.png", width="100%">
			The final iteration: Cleaning up the colour palette and design language, refining hierarchy between labels and content.
			<img src="../pics/dessa/iter3.png", width="100%">

			<h3> ‚ú® Result</h3>
			After a few rounds of iterating, I landed on an interface that was much more cohesive and supported the complex use cases that machine learning engineers required. <br><br>

			Here are the key features of the final design:
			<ol>
			<li> An overview page that gives users an instant, visual assessment over their experiments</li>
			<li> A new style that better highlights the high important information and lets information of lower priority fade into the background while keeping their presence</li>
			<li> Collaborative features like commenting and project descriptions for inter-team functionality </li>
			</ol>

			<h3> ü§î Learnings and Reflections </h3>

			This experience really pushed the importance of good, regular communication in design work. I think in a startup, it can be tempting to just pump through tasks for the sake of completion, but I realized that establishing a strong cross-team collaboration mindset is immensely beneficial.
			<br><br>

			Involving PMs and developers more throughout the process would have helped us avoid bumps like miscommunication about the feasibility of certain features, or the small issues arising that led us astray from the design.

			<br><br>
			As a designer I also learned to be more detailed in how I pass on my designs - every screen should have a few copies of how they would look on different sizes, edge cases like really long text boxes or empty states also need to be designed since people do not read minds - just cause' I know how it looks, if it's not visible, there's no guarantee that it'll turn out how it's expected to be.
