			<h3> The Problem </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>Machine learning is a field that is complex and nuanced, where everybody has their own preferred methods, infrastructures and technologies. However, there are certain pain points that are shared, like how to keep track of thousands of experiments,  models and results. The goal of our product, Atlas, was to make the lives of machine learning engineers easier with experiment management, resource management, and a way to track and analyze results.
				<br><br>
				I wanted to redesign our early-stage products to be simple and comfortable to use, while supporting different workflows and incorporating new features.

			<h3> Outcome </h3>	
				<ul>
					<li>A new, cleaner design that makes it easier to navigate and makes complex use-cases more intuitive</li>
					<li>New overview page to support team functionality</li>

					<li>Complete visual redesign based on feedback collected from users </li>
				</ul>

			<h1> The Process </h1>
			<h3> üîç Research and design audit </h3>	
			<p class='center_text'>

				My first task was to identify problems with the current interface. Just at a glance, I could see there was an overall lack of cohesiveness in the design. Being a technical product that displays a lot of data and visualizations, it's important to use design elements effectively so that information is properly displayed and can be absorbed in an intuitive way.</br></br>

				I conducted five user interviews to dig into their habits, find out what kind of usecases to design for, and what they feel is lacking from the current design.

			<!-- How can we make software to support engineers that is flexible, intuitive to use and feature-rich? -->
			</p>
			<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è Interview Questions </h3>	

			<ul>
				<li>Do you use Atlas? If so, why? If not, why not?</li>
				<li>What are you trying to do in your machine learning projects?</li>
				<li>Is feature X valuable to the work you do right now?</li>
				<li>What do you look for in your experiment results?</li>

			</ul>

			I kept the interviews mostly open-ended (although it was a redesign, we still had a lot of flexibility with the features and user flow) and left with a few observations:

			<ul>
				<li>Users wanted more ways to directly assess their experiments</li>
				<li>In terms of workflows, there were some diverging preferences like whether to view all experiments together, or have separate views for ongoing/finished/queued</li>
				<li>The command line integration was clumsy</li>

			</ul>

			<h3> üëî Stakeholder Requirements </h3>
			In addition to user preferences, there were some restrictions and additional functionalities to be designed for in the project scope.
			<ul>
				<li>The interface should support teams, i.e. be able to comment, sign in, have an account</li>
				<li>Non-machine-learning experts should be able to understand the project / get a sense of the progress </li>

			</ul>
